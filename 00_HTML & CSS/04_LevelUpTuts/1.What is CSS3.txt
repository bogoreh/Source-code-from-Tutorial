CSS3 is the latest standard for CSS.

CSS3 is completely backwards-compatible with earlier CSS versions.

Some of the most significant new features are:

Border radius - allows us to create rounded corners for elements.

Border images - allows us to specify an image as the border around an element.

Multiple backgrounds - applies multiple backgrounds to elements.

Animations and effects, and much more!
